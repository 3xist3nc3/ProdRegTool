# ProdRegTool
A product registration tool-software. Written in C++.

--The Vision--

My vision for the Product Registration Tool - "ProdRegTool" - is that it should be a easy-to-use product registration software, where users can register products they're selling, group them in product lists, create labels, tags, fill in product details, etc. The software should be everything a salesperson needs to keep track of their products.

This is my first "real" C++ project, and I will update it whenever I learn the next important thing that will improve the software.

Feel free to take a look at the current working version of it here: https://github.com/3xist3nc3/ProdRegTool/blob/master/ProdRegTool%20%E2%80%93%20vrs.0.03.exe
